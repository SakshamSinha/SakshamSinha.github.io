  desc: Geographic alienation is one of the main problems faced by farm producers today. The sole purpose of this project is to bridge this gap between the producers in the villages and their consumers in the towns and the cities, to help farmers boost their income by exposing their products to the free and fair competitive world. I was involved in developing solution for direct marketing of farm produce in urban market eliminating role of middle man, brokers and agents, thereby increasing rural people and farmersâ€™ income for overall economic growth of the country. By providing web based advisory system as well as android app for the farmers, we try to break the long chains of middlemen by only letting NGOs or self-help groups act as an interface to the outside world.I worked on Spring MVC, HTML 5, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular JS, AJAX, Spring data JPA, JQuery, Hibernate.
